Hi Alex,

It's great connecting with you. Thank you so much for your message.

I am just wondering to know about in below situation how you are managing your process...

=> Your company is providing SEO services, so how you are managing web, graphics designing, web and mobile apps development services.
=> As you are focusing on SEO services, may be you don't have inhouse resources for Web development and mobile apps development. Am I correct?
=> If you have some inhouse development team, then are you guys working on Laravel, Angular, Node, Reactjs plus hybride mobile apps using React native, Flutter, IONIC, Phonegape? What are you doing if you are having any inquiry for these technologies projects? Do you do outsource?

I would like to discuss all 3 points in detail, so we can know more about what type of technical bariars are you facing where we can help you by providing quality and cost effective services.

We don't have SEO team in our office and as we are focusing only on development and design work, we are receiving so many SEO, SMM/SMO and other internet marketing projects from our clients which we are outsourcing to other SEO companies. 

So if you are interested, we are ready to discuss about a long-term collaboration where we can help you with Internet Marketing projects and you can help us with Designing, Development projects.

I would like to share some graphics design work with you as below:

E-commerce

Hi Sir,

Greetings!

I have gone through your project scope of work. Based on your requirements, I have one question. 

1. As you are investing that much of money, then why are you looking for any ready made solution instead of building new?

The reason is, If you really want to make your product very successful then you must have a unique system with unique layouts, unique content. 

Google and other search engines are reviewing all the websites in the world and compare it with other existing systems. If they found copy of any other system, then they will not give any ratings in SEO activities even they will give negative results as they will count your system as a copy of other.

So I recommend you to have a new unique system which will save your money plus give best results. 

However, we are comfortable to provide you both type of solutions, as we have enough experience in development of e-commerce portals.
